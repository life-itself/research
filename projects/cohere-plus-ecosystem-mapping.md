**The purpose of this 3-year project is to enhance the collective capacities of European change agents and learn together how to transform "metacrisis", moving together towards a regenerative, cohesive, and healthy Europe.** 

Our focus is on the field of "paradigmatic" change agents in Europe: those who can be identified as taking whole-systems, integrative approaches towards paradigmatic societal transformation. Cohere+ combines research, events, technology development, and educational offerings in order to: map the European ‘transformational change’ field; engage with agents to build community and coherence within the field; and develop the collective capacities of change agents across Europe to co-create regenerative systems and societies.
