**This project focuses on an initial scoping exercise to: find and map polycrisis actors in the “Global South”; build a prototype directory; and reflect on what it means to be responding to polycrisis.** 

The effects of the global polycrisis are being ever more keenly felt and there is a growing set of actors who are explicitly responding to this set of interconnected crises. These actors are often disparate, spread across the globe with limited strategic coordination with one another. Even the terminology used to describe our current time of crisis is not universally shared. 

Mapping those actors responding to the polycrisis has been identified as a highly valuable activity by many of us working in this area; mapping is the first step towards cohering the field of work responding to the polycrisis and facilitating the shared awareness, strategic alignment, peer learning and collaboration required to increase impact.

This project is supported by the Omega Resilience Awards (ORA), and is in collaboration with key stakeholders engaged in aligned efforts to map the polycrisis: Cascade Institute, Post Carbon Institute, and Polycrisis Transition Consultancy.
