>The late 2022 FTX scandal seems like a plausible end to the era of blockchain mania, so 2023 is a good time to look back and ask ourselves, “What can we learn from crypto thus far?” After all, local governments will face increasing pressure to adopt new technologies, not just blockchain/cryptocurrency. Artificial intelligence and augmented reality/metaverse are two examples, and there are many others. Perhaps some will be useful or even revolutionary, but others may fall flat. The ups and downs of crypto/blockchain can provide guidance on how to navigate the stories (or hype) around these new technologies that promise great things for the public but also risk wasting considerable tax money if they don’t work.
