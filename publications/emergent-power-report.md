## Executive Summary

>In response to global crises, a growing number of individuals and organisations are questioning dominant systems, worldviews, and practices – and developing alternative ways of living and working. We refer to this as an “emerging ecosystem”: it still does not have a clear name or identity. Some of the terms with which this ecosystem might be associated include: “Metamodern”, “Polycrisis”, “Metacrisis”, “Regenerative”, “Great Turning”, “Integral”, “Holistic”, and “Second Renaissance”. In previous work, we have begun to identify some of its key characteristics. In particular, there seems to be a novel approach towards social change that is simultaneously “paradigmatic”, “integrated”, and “pragmatic”.
>
>A key question for our research is: what is needed to support this emerging ecosystem to become a system with real power and influence? We take as a starting point that this ecosystem contains and is developing knowledge and practices that can support collective responses to current socio-ecological crises. Specifically, this report seeks to understand: **what inner capacities do change agents in the emerging ecosystem need to develop so that the ecosystem becomes more powerful and better able to contribute to life-serving socio-ecological transformation?**
>
>We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 individuals working within the ecosystem. In this report, we synthesise insights from across the interviews.
>
>We begin by asking what are the most important challenges that the ecosystem faces in becoming a system with enough influence to create attractive and viable alternatives to mainstream ways of living and working – in order to identify the ‘gaps’ where it makes sense to focus time and energy at present. The three key ecosystem-level challenges we articulate are:
>
>1- Developing healthy relational cultures
>2- Cultivating emergent ways of working together
>3- Reckoning with dominant cultural paradigms
>
>With these challenges in mind, we then identify six key “capacities for the future” that individuals and groups within the ecosystem should focus on developing:
>
>1- Ease with uncertainty and complexity
>2- Critical inquiry into existing mental structures
>3- Addressing reactivity, tension, and conflict
>4- Agency and capacity to implement vision
>5- Acting in service of the greater whole
>6- Collective inner resourcing
