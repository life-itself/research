# Building the Field for Deliberately Developmental Spaces 

This project is a very first step in the field-building efforts of a collaboration between Life Itself, the Fetzer Institute, Commonweal and the Eksk√§ret Foundation. Its focus is on an initial "survey of the field" to map stakeholders and programs and start forging connections and awareness. Focused on programs for youth and young adults (15-25 years old) in the US and Europe, we will be exploring what it looks like to be "deliberately developmental", profile relevant organizations, looking at their programs, approach and philosophy.
