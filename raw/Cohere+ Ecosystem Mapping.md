# Cohere+ Ecosystem Mapping

European citizens are living through a time of multiple crises: ecological destruction, polarised societies, threats to freedom and democracy and more. We need major shifts in our economy, governance, and infrastructure to improve the health and wellbeing of European citizens for generations to come. A growing field of people, organisations, and initiatives already recognise the deep interconnectedness of global crises and deep insufficiencies in contemporary ways of living and working. The actors in what we call the European transformational change field are responding with whole-systems approaches to social, cultural, political, and economic change. We have outlined what we see as some of the core characteristics and commonalities among actors in this field [here](https://lifeitself.org/ecosystem). 

However, many societal change pioneers are struggling to change systems on their own. Unsupported by financial and academic norms, their activities and responses to our crises are often overlooked by mainstream culture. And yet true innovation often happens in the margins. Meanwhile, lack of resource, communication, or understanding between related organisations means that efforts are often duplicated or not as strategically aligned as they could be to work together towards common visions and goals. Currently, there is also an education gap: traditional education systems are not empowering citizens with the collective knowledge, skills, capacities, and values we need to work together to transition beyond current, complex crises. 

Therefore, field-building and capacity-building for greater collaboration and coherence among change agents are key in paving the way towards a more regenerative, cohesive and healthy Europe.

The overall objectives of the Cohere+ project are:

1. To increase and enhance the self-knowledge and self-awareness of key actors and organisations in the European transformational social change field, so that the field is more visible to itself and its effectiveness in strategic alignment is improved;
2. To support and facilitate greater connections and more effective transdisciplinary and transnational collaborations within the field;
3. To increase the visibility and accessibility of the field to broader European society so as to increase participation and boost its potential for impact;
4. To educate change agents and citizens within and beyond the field, to build the field’s spheres of influence and thus leverage our collective power to co-create the future Europe we want to live in.
