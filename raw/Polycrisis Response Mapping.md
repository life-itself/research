# Polycrisis Response Mapping 

The effects of the global polycrisis are being ever more keenly felt and there is a growing set of actors who are explicitly responding to this set of interconnected crises. These actors are often disparate, spread across the globe with limited strategic coordination with one another. Even the terminology used to describe our current time of crisis is not universally shared.Â 

Mapping those actors responding to the polycrisis has been identified as a highly valuable activity by many of us working in this area; mapping is the first step towards cohering the field of work responding to the polycrisis and facilitating the shared awareness, strategic alignment, peer learning and collaboration required to increase impact.
